# CSV Export Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the CSV export functionality in the run results table to include more comprehensive data with improved column organization and support for notes annotations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CSV Export Functionality (`src/lib/utils/csvExport.ts`)

Created a new utility module with the following features:

- **Variable Columns**: Added support for including variable columns in the leftmost positions (after the Test column)
- **Notes Support**: Added optional Notes columns after each Environment column when annotations are available
- **Improved Structure**: Organized CSV with proper header, provider, and prompt rows
- **Data Handling**: Proper handling of different data types (strings, objects, arrays, null/undefined)
- **CSV Formatting**: Proper quote escaping and formatting for CSV compliance

#### Key Functions:

- `generateCsvContent(run: LiveRun, options: CsvExportOptions): string` - Generates CSV content from run data
- `downloadCsv(content: string, filename: string): void` - Handles file download

### 2. Updated Run Results Table Component (`src/lib/components/run-results/run-results-table.svelte`)

- Refactored the `downloadCsv()` function to use the new utility
- Added support for annotations detection and inclusion
- Simplified the component logic by extracting CSV generation to utility

### 3. CSV Structure

The enhanced CSV export now includes:

```
| Test | var1 | var2 | Provider1 | Provider1 Notes | Provider2 | Provider2 Notes |
|------|------|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Provider |  |  | openai:gpt-3.5 |  | anthropic:claude |  |
| Prompt |  |  | "Your prompt 1" |  | "Your prompt 2" |  |
| Test 1 | value1 | value2 | Result 1 | Note 1 | Result 2 | Note 2 |
```

### 4. Features Implemented

#### Variable Columns

- Variables are displayed in the same order as in the Results Table
- Supports all data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays)
- Handles null/undefined values appropriately
- JSON stringifies complex objects

#### Notes Integration

- Notes columns are only included when annotations are available
- Each environment gets its own notes column
- Notes are fetched from the annotation system
- Empty notes are handled gracefully

#### Data Type Handling

- **Strings**: Direct inclusion
- **Numbers**: Converted to strings
- **Objects/Arrays**: JSON stringified
- **null/undefined**: Converted to empty strings
- **Errors**: Error messages included
- **File outputs**: Converted to markdown image syntax

#### CSV Compliance

- Proper quote escaping (double quotes become double-double quotes)
- All cells are quoted for consistency
- Handles newlines and special characters

### 5. Comprehensive Unit Tests (`src/lib/utils/csvExport.test.ts`)

Created 9 comprehensive test cases covering:

- Basic CSV structure generation
- Variable column ordering and values
- Different output types handling
- Null/undefined variable handling
- Complex object JSON stringification
- Quote escaping in CSV content
- Unknown provider type handling
- Notes column inclusion/exclusion
- Empty variable arrays

## Usage

### Basic Usage (without notes)

```typescript
import { generateCsvContent } from '$lib/utils/csvExport';

const csvContent = generateCsvContent(liveRun);
```

### With Notes Support

```typescript
import { generateCsvContent } from '$lib/utils/csvExport';

const csvContent = generateCsvContent(liveRun, {
  includeNotes: true,
  annotations: annotationManager,
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Data Export**: Users can now export all variable data alongside test results
2. **Notes Integration**: Annotations and notes are preserved in the exported data
3. **Better Organization**: Variables are positioned logically in the leftmost columns
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All data types and edge cases are handled properly
5. **Maintainability**: Extracted logic into testable utility functions
6. **Reliability**: Comprehensive test suite ensures functionality works correctly

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are fully backward compatible. Existing CSV exports will continue to work, but with enhanced data and better organization.
